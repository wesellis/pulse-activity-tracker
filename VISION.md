# PULSE - Project Vision & Core Concepts

## üéØ **The Big Idea**
**An intelligent work-life balance automation system that tracks your entire day (desktop, mobile, life) and automatically manages productivity accountability.**

## üöÄ **Core Vision**
- **Track Everything**: Desktop apps, mobile usage, life activities (walks, lunch, errands)
- **Smart Todo Generation**: AI learns your patterns and creates tomorrow's tasks based on today's work
- **Auto-Compensation**: Took a long lunch? System automatically adds work time today or tomorrow
- **Boss Communication**: Curated professional reports showing productivity without personal details
- **Life Integration**: "Need to walk your dog but took an hour lunch? No worries, auto-tasker adds work time to compensate"

## üß† **Intelligent Features**

### **Pattern Learning**
- "You usually code for 3 hours after checking email ‚Üí adding 'finish API endpoint' to tomorrow"
- "Detected 45 minutes in Slack discussing Project X ‚Üí marking 'team sync' complete"
- "Pattern suggests you're most productive 9-11am ‚Üí scheduling deep work then"

### **Smart Compensation**
```
Scenario: Took 90-minute lunch (30 min over)
Options:
- Work 30 min later today (if energy level good)
- Add 30 min to tomorrow morning (if you're a morning person)
- Spread +10 min across next 3 days
- Take shorter lunch tomorrow (-30 min)
```

### **Auto-Todo Generation**
- **Continuation Logic**: "2+ hours in VSCode + github.com activity" ‚Üí likely coding work
- **Context Understanding**: Scan commits, document changes, TODO comments in code
- **Communication Parsing**: Extract action items from Slack/email
- **Calendar Integration**: "Meeting with John tomorrow" ‚Üí "Prepare presentation for John"

## üì± **Multi-Platform Tracking**

### **Desktop (Python)**
- Applications, windows, file access
- Browser history, code commits
- Productivity scoring
- Time tracking

### **Mobile (Future React Native)**
- Work app usage tracking
- Location-based todos
- Voice input for rapid todo entry
- Real-time sync with desktop

### **Life Integration**
- Calendar sync for appointments
- Health app integration for energy levels
- Weather integration for work optimization
- Location tracking for context

## ü§ñ **Boss Reporting - Auto-Curated**
```python
def generate_boss_report(day_data):
    report = {
        "productive_hours": 7.2,  # Actual work time
        "key_accomplishments": [
            "Completed API authentication module",
            "Reviewed 3 pull requests", 
            "Client call - project approved"
        ],
        "tomorrow_priorities": [
            "Deploy authentication updates",
            "Start database migration prep"
        ]
        # Note: Doesn't mention the dog walk or long lunch
    }
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend (Python)**
- **Activity Monitor**: psutil, pygetwindow, pynput
- **Pattern Analyzer**: scikit-learn, pandas
- **Todo Generator**: ML + rule-based suggestions
- **Report Builder**: Professional summaries
- **API Server**: FastAPI for web/mobile sync

### **Frontend Options**
- **Web Dashboard**: React with real-time updates
- **Mobile App**: React Native for cross-platform
- **Progressive Web App**: For universal access

### **Data Flow**
```
Desktop Python App ‚Üí Detects 2 hours of coding
    ‚Üì
Central API/Database ‚Üí Generates "Continue API work tomorrow"
    ‚Üì
Mobile App ‚Üí Shows notification + adds to tomorrow's list
    ‚Üì
User checks off on phone ‚Üí Updates desktop dashboard
```

## üé™ **The Magic Workflow**

### **Morning**
1. System shows AI-generated todos based on yesterday's patterns
2. Calendar integration suggests optimal work blocks
3. Energy level detection optimizes task difficulty

### **During Day**
1. Continuous activity monitoring
2. Real-time productivity scoring
3. Smart break suggestions
4. Auto-completion of detected work

### **Evening**
1. Day summary with accomplishments
2. Tomorrow's AI-generated task list
3. Time compensation calculations
4. Optional boss report generation

## üîí **Privacy & Control**
- **Local-first**: All data stored locally by default
- **Granular Controls**: Choose exactly what to track and share
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **User Consent**: You control what goes in boss reports

## üöÄ **Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Desktop (Weeks 1-2)**
- Basic activity tracking
- Simple todo list with manual entry
- Local SQLite database
- Basic web dashboard

### **Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 3-4)**
- Pattern recognition for work habits
- Smart todo generation
- Auto-completion detection
- Simple reporting

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)**
- Mobile app with sync
- Advanced ML predictions
- Calendar/external tool integration
- Professional reporting dashboard

### **Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (Weeks 7-8)**
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- API documentation
- Deployment automation

## üåü **Why This Is Revolutionary**

**Current State**: Remote workers manually track time, create todos, and report productivity
**Pulse State**: AI handles all productivity admin, learns your patterns, maintains professional accountability while letting you live naturally

**The Genius**: Becomes your personal work-life balance AI assistant that:
1. Lets you live your life naturally
2. Automatically maintains professional accountability  
3. Optimizes your schedule for when you actually work best
4. Handles the "admin" of being a remote worker

## üéØ **Success Metrics**
- **Time Savings**: 15-30 minutes daily ‚Üí 0-2 minutes daily
- **Productivity**: Higher quality work during optimal hours
- **Stress Reduction**: No more productivity guilt or manual tracking
- **Professional**: Consistent, professional reporting without micromanagement
